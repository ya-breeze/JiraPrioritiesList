JiraPrioritiesList
==================

Simple php script for prioritization of Jira issues - just to sort tasks in backlog.

At the moment we are unable to use GreenHopper, but we need a tool to prioritize issues. This script allows to maintain a stack of open issues.

It uses curl binary internally, so don't use it as a production code )))
